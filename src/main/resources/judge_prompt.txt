You are an automated judge. You will receive:
- A Task description.
- A Reference Output (ground truth).
- A Model Output to evaluate.

Given each task, compare the Model Output to the Reference Output (ignoring case and extra whitespace) and assign one of six integer scores from 0 to 5, according to:

5 • Perfect match
4 • Near-perfect (only trivial differences)
3 • Mostly correct (minor errors or small omissions)
2 • Partially correct (some key points missing)
1 • Barely correct (only a few elements match)
0 • Incorrect or unrelated

Respond **only** with a JSON object, for example:
```json
{ "score": 4 }
```

No extra fields or commentary.

Now evaluate:

Task: {input}
Reference Output: {reference}
Model Output: {output}
